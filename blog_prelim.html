<p>Alexandria, VA, January 27, 2015 — The Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA), the national association representing PA educational programs, announced that it will relocate its headquarters to the Association of American Medical Colleges&rsquo; (AAMC) office building in downtown Washington, D.C. As of March 31, PAEA&rsquo;s offices will be located in the AAMC building at 655 K Street, NW.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PAs and physicians have been working together to provide health care since the PA profession was established in the 1960s,&rdquo; said PAEA CEO Timi Agar Barwick, MPM. &ldquo;With the enormous and growing demands on our health care system, team-based care is more important than ever, and the PA-physician relationship can provide the foundation for that team. Sharing offices with the AAMC will allow us to model and reinforce this vital interprofessional approach at the national association level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the AAMC designed its new headquarters and two-story learning center, we envisioned a space that would foster collaboration among our 600 employees and constituents at the nation&rsquo;s medical schools and teaching hospitals, as well as across health professions,&rdquo; said AAMC President and CEO Darrell G. Kirch, M.D. &ldquo;We are pleased to welcome PAEA to share our home as we continue to develop a vibrant interprofessional education community at 655 K Street. Sharing our space with an organization such as PAEA, whose mission aligns with the AAMC, brings with it many opportunities for collaboration and engagement in medical education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The relationship between PAEA and the AAMC has the potential to go far beyond sharing space. With a history of previous collaborative efforts, this move will allow the two organizations to step up their level of engagement,&rdquo; said Barwick.</p>
<h2> Collaboration</h2>
<p>Leadership from both associations are actively working to identify opportunities for collaborating on issues ranging from medical education, research, admissions, member engagement, and advocacy. The American Dental Education Association is also located in the AAMC building, offering additional collaborative opportunities.</p>
<p>The new offices will position PAEA close to Capitol Hill and federal health care and education agencies, allowing staff and members greater access to policymakers to advocate for the role of PA education in improving national health care outcomes.</p>
<p>PAEA will have access to the AAMC&rsquo;s two-story learning center and conference facility, which includes a 200-person multipurpose room and eight additional conference rooms, as well as a rooftop terrace and café for member and staff functions. With an abundance of natural light, the building was designed to achieve a LEED Gold certification in the U.S. Green Building Council&rsquo;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system.</p>
<p>The Physician Assistant Education Association (PAEA) is a not-for-profit association representing accredited physician assistant educational programs in the United States. PAEA provides services for faculty at its member programs, as well as to applicants, students, and other stakeholders. Additional information about PAEA is available at <a href="http://paeaonline.org">PAEAonline.org</a>.</p>
